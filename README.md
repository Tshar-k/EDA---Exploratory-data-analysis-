# Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository consists of codes that analyze different datasets and give some important insights about the data using graphical methods. It also consists of some codes in which data engineering is being performed with the dataset to make it ready for analysis

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using:
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn
